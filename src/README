This program provides the optimal value and optimal activites for an instance of the weighted activity problem.

How to compile: 
	type make
How to run: 
	DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ALG: make dt
	GREEDY ALG: make gt1, make gt2...
	*In which dt stands for dynamic test & gt for greedy test

Each line of the input should follow the following format:
start time,end time,weight

The output file will contain the items included in the optimal solution, plus the optimal weight.
